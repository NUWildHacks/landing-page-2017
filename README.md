### Getting started
1. We're going to be using Sass as our CSS preprocessor so make sure [you have it installed on your machine](http://sass-lang.com/install)
2. Read the [Sass documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html)
3. Once installed, compile & watch styles by running the command `sass --watch styles/sass:styles/css`, or the script `bash bin/watch.sh`
